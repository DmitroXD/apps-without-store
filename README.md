# 📦 Microsoft Store App Downloader & Installer (Go)

A lightweight utility that allows you to **download and install Microsoft Store applications directly** using only their **Store URL**.
The program automatically detects your system architecture, retrieves all available `.appx` and `.msixbundle` packages, downloads them, and installs them through PowerShell.

No Microsoft Store app required.
No manual file searching.
Everything is automated.

## ✨ Features

* **Automatic architecture detection**
  Detects Windows architecture (`x64`, `x86`, `arm64`) based on `runtime.GOARCH`.

* **User-provided Microsoft Store URL**
  No hardcoded tokens — you simply paste the link.

* **Automatic parsing of available download packages**
  Extracts `.appx` and `.msixbundle` files from the public `store.rg-adguard.net` API.

* **Batch download and installation**
  Downloads dependency packages first, then installs the main `.msixbundle`.

* **Full PowerShell integration**
  Uses `Add-AppxPackage` to perform proper app installation.

* **Structured download folders**
  Files are stored under `downloads/<token>` for clarity.

* **Clear logging**
  Console logs show each step: parsing, selecting files, downloading, installation.

## 🖼 How It Works (In Short)

1. You paste a **Microsoft Store app URL**, for example:

   ```
   https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NKSQGP7F2NH
   ```

2. The program submits the link to the public API (`store.rg-adguard.net`).

3. An HTML table with all package links is returned.

4. The app:

   * Parses the table
   * Filters files based on architecture
   * Downloads `.appx` dependencies
   * Downloads and installs `.msixbundle` main package

5. Uses PowerShell to install everything cleanly.

## ⚙️ How Installation Works

The installer executes:

```powershell
Add-AppxPackage -Path "<downloaded file>"
```

Dependencies (`.appx`) are installed first.
Main bundles (`.msixbundle`) are installed last.

## 🔒 Safety & Legal Notes

* The application uses **publicly available URLs** generated by `store.rg-adguard.net`.
* It does **not** modify files, remove DRM, or bypass licensing.
* Users are responsible for ensuring that downloaded packages are legally allowed in their region.
